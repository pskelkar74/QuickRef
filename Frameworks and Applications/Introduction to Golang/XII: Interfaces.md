# Interfaces in Go

Interfaces are a type at the end. Interfaces don't describe data, they describe behavior of objects. So they store method definitions instead.

Interfaces are not explicitly implemented, but are inferred implicitly. If a concrete type needs to be wrapped by an interface, the interface can implicitly latch to this concrete type if defined as the interface of a type defined.
