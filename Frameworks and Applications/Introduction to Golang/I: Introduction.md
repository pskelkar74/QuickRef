# Introduction to Golang

## Why Golang

Golang was mainly created because
1. Python is easy to use, but slow
2. Java has an increasingly complex type system
3. C/C++ has a slow compile times, as optimality was achieved by compilers trying to minimize memory

These languages also did not exploit threading, and thus not utilising concurrency.

## Features of Go

Go is
1. Strong and statically type (Types of variables cannot change over time)
2. Extremely community dependent
3. Simple to use
4. Fast to compile
5. A garbage collected language
6. Built for concurrency
7. Used for compiling to standalone binaries
