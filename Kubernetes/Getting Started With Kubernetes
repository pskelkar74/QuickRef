Containers are becoming the standard unit of deployment. 
Each container image has:
1. Code
2. Binaries
3. Configuration
4. Libraries
5. Frameworks
6. Runtime
Makes the job of DevOps very easy

Docker solved the problem of packaging, deploying and running containerized applications.
Docker has the 3 components:
1. Container engine
2. Registry
3. Tools
Docker is great for few containers running on few machines.
However, production applications deal with dozens of containers running on hundreds of machines.

Unit of deployments change from machine to a container.
The infrastructures are become immutable.

We think of applications with emphasis on treating datacenters as a cluster.

The new datacenter infrastructure use tools like docker swarm, kubernetes and mesosphere CD/OS.
These manage the lifecycle of containerized applications running in production.
These also automate the distribution of applications and ensure higher levels of utilization
and efficiency.
