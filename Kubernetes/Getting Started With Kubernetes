Containers are becoming the standard unit of deployment. 
Each container image has:
1. Code
2. Binaries
3. Configuration
4. Libraries
5. Frameworks
6. Runtime
Makes the job of DevOps very easy

Docker solved the problem of packaging, deploying and running containerized applications.
Docker has the 3 components:
1. Container engine
2. Registry
3. Tools
Docker is great for few containers running on few machines.
However, production applications deal with dozens of containers running on hundreds of machines.
