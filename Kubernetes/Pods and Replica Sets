A pod is a group of containers that are always co-located and co-scheduled that share the context.
Containers in a pod share the same IP address, ports, hostname and storage
Pods are scheduled in Nodes and are modeled like VMs, where each container represents one process.
They are also tightly coupled with other containers in the same pod.
They act as the fundamental unit of deployment in kubernetes.
