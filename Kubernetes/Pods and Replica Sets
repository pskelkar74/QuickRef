A pod is a group of containers that are always co-located and co-scheduled that share the context.
Containers in a pod share the same IP address, ports, hostname and storage
Pods are scheduled in Nodes and are modeled like VMs, where each container represents one process.
They are also tightly coupled with other containers in the same pod.
They act as the fundamental unit of deployment in kubernetes.

A sample pod YAML looks like this

apiVersion: "v1"
kind: Pod   //Specify the kind of k8s object
metadata: 
    name: mypod
    labels: 
        app: demo
        env: test
spec:   //Define specification 
    containers:
        -   name: nginx
            image: nginx
            ports: 
                -   name: http
                    containerPort: 80
                    protocol: TCP
