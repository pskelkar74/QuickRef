Replica sets are associated with pod definitions in a different way than replication controller
RC uses equality, whereas sets can use much more complex definitions.

Deployments provide declarative updates for pods and Replica sets
They define the state of the application and k8s ensures that the cluster maintains the
desired state of the application
Deployment objects are flexible for managing and scaling applications in k8s

Deployments are used to 
1. Create a Deployment
2. Update a Deployment
3. Perform rolling updates
4. Perform rollback
5. Pause/Resume a Deployment

Canary Deployments are done by rolling an update to only a subset of users before sharing it to 
all users.
BlueGreen Deployments are done by having two simultaenous production environments where the Blue 
environment runs an updated version and the Green environment runs the previous version.
