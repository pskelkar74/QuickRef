Containers are designed to be stateless
They use ephemeral storage
Pods can be stateful using volumes
Database runs are challenging due to 
1. Lack of stable naming convention
2. Lack of stable persistent storage per Pod

StatefulSets bring the concept of ReplicaSets to stateful Pods
It enables running pods in clustered modes
These are usually ideal for deploying highly available database workloads
It is usually valuable for apps that need:
1. Stable, unique network identifiers
2. Stable, persistent storage
3. Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling
4. Ordered, graceful deletion and termination
