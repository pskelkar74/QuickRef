Kubernetes controllers include
1. Replica Sets
2. Deployments
3. Stateful Sets
4. Daemon Sets
5. Jobs (One Time)
6. Cron Jobs

Daemon sets run a copy of a pod on every node in a Kubernetes cluster
Daemon sets and Replica sets are similar but have different use cases
New nodes automatically gets a Daemon Set pod
When a node is removed, the daemon set pod will not be rescheduled

Total number of pods in the daemon set = the number of nodes in the cluster

Daemon sets bypass the scheduler and every node gets a pod. Replica sets provision pods unevenly over
the nodes
Daemon sets are used in
1. logging aggregators
2. monitoring
3. load balancers, reverse proxies, API gateways
4. Generic background Jobs

There are two types of job controllers in Kubernetes
1. One time / Run on completion
2. Scheduled Jobs
Both are extremely useful in performing batch operations
Jobs complement other controllers like Replica Set and Daemon set
