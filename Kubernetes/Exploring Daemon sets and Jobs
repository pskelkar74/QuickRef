Kubernetes controllers include
1. Replica Sets
2. Deployments
3. Stateful Sets
4. Daemon Sets
5. Jobs (One Time)
6. Cron Jobs

Daemon sets run a copy of a pod on every node in a Kubernetes cluster
Daemon sets and Replica sets are similar but have different use cases
New nodes automatically gets a Daemon Set pod
When a node is removed, the daemon set pod will not be rescheduled

Total number of pods in the daemon set = the number of nodes in the cluster

Daemon sets bypass the scheduler and every node gets a pod. Replica sets provision pods unevenly over
the nodes
Daemon sets are used in
1. logging aggregators
2. monitoring
3. load balancers, reverse proxies, API gateways
4. Generic background Jobs
