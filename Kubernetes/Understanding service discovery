A service is an abstraction of a logical set of pods defined by a policy
The pods have very ephemeral IPs and once a pod is desstroyed and brought back up, they need to be referenced
These can be front-end or backend pods, and usually, might be referenced through DNS techniques, but not in the case
of ephemeral IPs

A service acts as an intermediary for pods to talk to each other.
Selectors are used to access the pods that match a specific label
Each service exposes one of more ports and targetPorts

The targetPort is mapped to the port exposed by matching pods
The K8s service supports TCP and UDP
