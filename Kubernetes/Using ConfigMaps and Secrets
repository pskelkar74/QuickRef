ConfigMaps are used to inject native configurations into k8s
Secrets are similar to ConfigMaps, but are used for sensitive information transfer

Applications expect configurations from 
1. configuration files
2. CLI arguments
3. Env variables

Container images generally shouldn't hold application configuration to keep containerized applications portable.

ConfigMaps are kubernetes objects for injecting containers with configuration data
They keep the containers agnostic of kubernetes (no refractoring)
They can be used to store fine-grained or coarse-grained configuration
They hold configurations in Key-Value pairs accessible to Pods
They are similar to the /etc directory and files in Linux OS

Configuration data can be used to 
1. Populate the value of environment variables
2. Set CLI in a container
3. Populate configuration files in a volume

Users and system components may store configuration data in a ConfigMap

A secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, token or Key
Secrets reduce the risk of exposing sensitive data to unwanted entities
Like ConfigMaps, Secrets are K8s API objects created outside of Pods
Secrets belong to a specific K8s namespace
The size of each secret cannot exceed 1 MB
