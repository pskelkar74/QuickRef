ConfigMaps are used to inject native configurations into k8s
Secrets are similar to ConfigMaps, but are used for sensitive information transfer

Applications expect configurations from 
1. configuration files
2. CLI arguments
3. Env variables

Container images generally shouldn't hold application configuration to keep containerized applications portable.
