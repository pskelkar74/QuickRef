Microservices are smaller processes that break up large monolithic programs to perform minimized tasks.

Advantages of Microservices:
1. Language independent
2. Fast iterations
3. Small teams
4. Fault isolation
5. Pairs well with containers
6. SCALABLE - containerize these microservices

Disadvantages of Microservices:
1. Complex networking - Tracing back is very hard
2. Overhead of managing databases and servers
