Why do we need docker?
1. The matrix of hell is a compatibility matrix to be made on every OS to link application stacks to the environment
2. Compatibility was an issue.
3. Modify the underlying frameworks without setting up entire application or service stacks.
4. Docker helps containerize applications.
5. Containers are isolated environments that share the same kernel, unlike virtual machines.
6. Docker uses LXC Containers.
