Why do we need docker?
1. The matrix of hell is a compatibility matrix to be made on every OS to link application stacks to the environment
2. Compatibility was an issue.
3. Modify the underlying frameworks without setting up entire application or service stacks.
4. Docker helps containerize applications.
5. Containers are isolated environments that share the same kernel, unlike virtual machines.
6. Docker uses LXC Containers. 

Sharing a kernel - Run any OS on top of a kernel if its the same type of OS kernel (Linux maybe)
Windows based containers cant be run with linux on it, for example. When a linux container is made to run on windows,
windows makes a linux virtual machine run the docker container.

Unlike hypervisors, docker doesnt run kernels. Docker just containerizes them.

Containers vs VMs
1. Docker sits on top of the OS, and manages the containers. The Hypervisor in a VM makes an OS on top of the OS.
2. VMs take higher disk space, docker is light.
3. Docker has less isolation because it runs on the same OS kernel, VMs have complete isolation.
4. You usually use containers in VMs to use both technologies.

How is it done?
1. DockerHub has some images already made and published to use on the fly.
2. docker run ansible, docker run nodejs, etc all work.
3. It can run many instances of the same machine, with a configured load balancer
4. Fault control also works by just destroying instances.
