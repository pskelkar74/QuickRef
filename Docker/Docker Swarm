docker swarm init - Initialises the swarm 

Swarm is a multi-host cluster and the node calling init acts as the master and a worker. The 
workers can join the cluster with the swarm token.

The standard compose file can be use to drive the docker swarm, but ignores the build service key.

docker stack deploy -c <compose-file> <app>- used to deploy stacks specified by the compose files

docker stack ls - list all the stacks deployed to the swarms
docker service ls - list all the services related to the swarm, works only with docker swarm

You can deploy multiple stacks running in parallel, for example a front-end, back-end and 
monitoring stack.

docker stack services <appname> - list ot services in a given stack
docker service scale <app-service> = <replicas> - scaling up a service 
docker swarm leave -f - leave the swarm and destroy it.
docker-machine ls - gives the virtual machines set up
docker-machine start <vmname> - starts the VM

For setting up swarm on 2 machines:
1. Log into a machine and do docker swarm init.
2. Specify a network adapter for the swarm.
3. In the other machine, join using docker swarm join
4. Push the application images to DockerHub
5. docker-machine env <vmname> gives the environment variables
6. Use 5 to set the env variables on the VM according to your local machine to execute in the VM
daemon.
7. Do docker stack deploy -c <YAML file> <app>
8. Done, docker swarm with 2 machines is set up
