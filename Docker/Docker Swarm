docker swarm init - Initialises the swarm 

Swarm is a multi-host cluster and the node calling init acts as the master and a worker. The 
workers can join the cluster with the swarm token.

The standard compose file can be use to drive the docker swarm, but ignores the build service key.

docker stack deploy -c <compose-file> <app>- used to deploy stacks specified by the compose files

docker stack ls - list all the stacks deployed to the swarms
docker service ls - list all the services related to the swarm, works only with docker swarm

You can deploy multiple stacks running in parallel, for example a front-end, back-end and 
monitoring stack.

docker stack services <appname> - list ot services in a given stack

docker service scale <app-service> = <replicas> - scaling up a service
