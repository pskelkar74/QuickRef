## Document Distance

Input: Given 2 documents, find the distance between them.
A document is a sequence of strings of alphanumeric characters.
The distance is the number of shared words.
The document is a vector where D[word] gives the frequency of that word in the document.

Output: Distance between them.

Basic approach template
1. Split document into words
2. Compute word frequencies

Approach 1 [O(nm)]:
```
1. Dot product of both vectors
2. Multiply all sorted words and sum them up.
```

Approach 2 [O(nm)]:
```
1. Dot product of both vectors
2. Multiply all sorted words and sum them up.
3. Divide by the product of the length of the two vector (angle between two vectors)
```

Approach 3 [max(O(n) + O(m))]:
```
Find dot products from the vectors directly using math.
