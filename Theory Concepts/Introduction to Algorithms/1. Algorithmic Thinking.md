# Algorithmic Thinking

## Peak Finding

### One dimensional version

For an array of numbers say : [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 6, 2, 4, 2]
We've to find a peak where A[i] is greater or equal to both A[i-1] and A[i+1].

Input: Array, N
Output: Peak element if it exists

Approach 1 [O(n)]:
```
1. Start from the left
2. Walk across and find the highest element
```

Approach 2 [O(log n)]:
```
1. Look at the n/2 position (Binary search)
2. If it is lesser than the previous, discard upper half
3. If it is lesser than the next, discard lower half
4. If all these fail, the n/2 position is a peak
```

### Two dimensional version

For a matrix of numbers say:
[[1, 2, 3, 4],
[2, 3, 4, 5],
[2, 2, 2, 1],
[1, 2, 3, 1]]
We've to find the peak in 2D space
Output: 3

Approach 1 [Greedy Ascent - O(nm)]:
```
1. Traverse through element
2. Compare left and right neighbours, and move where the value increases
3. Do so till peak is found
```

Approach 2 [Divide and Conquer - O(n*log m)]:
```
1. Pick a middle column j = m/2
2. Find global max on column j at (i, j)
3. Compare (i, j-1), (i, j) and (i, j+1)
4. Pick left cols if (i, j-1) > (i,j) and vice versa for right
5. If (i,j) is >= (i, j-1) and (i, j+1), that is the peak
