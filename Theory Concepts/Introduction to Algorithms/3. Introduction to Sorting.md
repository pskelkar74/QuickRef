# Introduction to Sorting

Input: Array of unsorted numbers
Output: Array of sorted numbers

## Insertion Sort

Approach - [O(n<sup>2</sup>)]:
```
Insert A[i] into sorted array A[0:i-1] by pairwise swaps to the correct position

[5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]
[2, 5, 4, 6, 1, 3]
[2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3]
[2, 4, 5, 1, 6, 3]
[2, 4, 1, 5, 6, 3]
[2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 3]
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3]
[1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6]
[1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Merge Sort

Approach - [O(n*log n)]:
```
Recursively divide the array into 2 and sort the 2 smaller subarrays by merging

[20, 13, 7, 2, 12, 11, 9, 1]
[[2, 7, 13, 20], [1, 9, 11, 12]]
[1, 2, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 20]
```
