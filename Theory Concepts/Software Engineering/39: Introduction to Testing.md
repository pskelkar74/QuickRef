# Introduction to Testing

- Testing is the process used to identify the correctness, completeness and quality of developed software
  - It is the process of verifying and validating the software product

- Principles of testing
  - Presence of defects
  - Exhaustive testing
  - Early testing
  - Defect testing
  - Defect clustering
  - Pesticide paradox
  - Testing is context dependent
  - Absence of errors policy

- Exhaustive testing
  - If everything needs to be tested, execution time and costs will rise exponentially
  - Exhaustive testing is not possible
  - We need optimal amount of testing based on the Risk assessment of the application

- Defect Clustering
  - Small number of modules contain most defects
  - You can identify these by experience

- Pesticide Paradox
  - If same tests are repeated, eventually the same test will no longer find new bugs
  - Keep changing tests

- Presence of defects
  - Testing only brings out bugs, doesn't rectify them

- Absence of errors
  - Is a fallacy
  - Software needs to meet the needs and requirements of the client

- Testing is context dependent
  - Not all tests can be same for different products
  - Need to depend on context

- STLC
  - Contract signing
  - Requirement analysis
  - Test planning
  - Test development
  - Test environment setup
  - Test execution
  - Retest defects
  - Test cycle closure

- Testing types
  - Functional
  - Structural
  - Static
    - Checks for sanity of code 
  - Dynamic
    - Checks test cases by observing execution

- Levels of testing types
  - Unit testing
  - Integration testing
  - System/Functional testing
  - Acceptance testing
