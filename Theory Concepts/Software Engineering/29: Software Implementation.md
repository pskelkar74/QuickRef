# Software Implementation

- Implementation
  - Starts post design and converts the program structures to code
  - Level of details dependent on language
  - Coding standards, guidelines and procedures help in translating designs into code

- Implementation is the detailed creation of working software through a combination of coding, reviews and unit testing

- Some goals 
  - Minimizing complexity
  - Anticipating change
  - Constructing for verification
  - Reuse
  - Construction for others to read

- Implementation has a dev environment
  - Integrated or discrete
  - Structure for holding code
  - Software Configuration Management system

- Construction overview
  - Produces a high volume of configuration items
  - Tool intensive
  - Related to software quality
  - Extensive use of CS knowledge

- Choice of language
  - Assembly
  - Procedural
    - Modest level of abstraction
  - Aspect oriented
    - Seperate concerns
  - Object oriented

- Development environment
  - Commercial vs open-source
  - Support of development process
  - Factors in selecting DEs
    - Security
    - Access to future capabilities
    - Size of product and distribution of dev team
    - Degree of integration between tools and environment

- Catching bugs
  - Code review
  - Unit testing
  - Integration testing
  - System testing
  - Field trials
  - Production

- Refractoring
  - External interface kept same while implementation is improved
  - Intended to improve the 
    - Design, structure of implementation
    - Improves objective attributes
    - Helps code understanding
  - Does not mean
    - Rewriting code
    - Fixing bugs
    - Improving interface
