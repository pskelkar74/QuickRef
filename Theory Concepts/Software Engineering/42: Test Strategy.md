# Test strategy

- Generics
  - Part of test planning
  - Describes the process or strategy which is going to be followed to test the application/software under development
  - Evolved in conjunction with the scope of testing which would be the first step and deals to achieve
    - Testing mindset or model to be followed
    - What test types are used in the process
    - Test environment to be used
    - Automation strategy
    - Tools
    - Risk analysis with contingency planning for the strategy

- Testing Models or Mindsets
  - Demonstration model/mindset
    - Makes sure the software passes all tests and solves the problems
    - No guidelines
  - Evaluation model/mindset
    - Detects faults through the lifecycle phases
    - Focus on analysis and review techniques to detect faults in the requirements and design documents
  - Destruction model/mindset
    - Try to make the software fail and find as many faults
    - Good and effective test cases are those that find faults
    - Difficult to decide when to stop testing
  - Preventive model/mindset
    - Prevents faults in early phases through careful planning
    - Test driven development

- Testing types chosen
  - Which types to be used as part of the strategy
  - Each of the lifecycle phases has outcomes which can be tested (statically/dynamically)
  - There were a different number of types of testing types

- Test execution environment
  - Testbeds are a setup of software and hardware teams to conduct testing
  - As per the need of application

- Tools to be used
  - Technology needs to be compatible with the tools used
  - Cross platform support is necessary
  - Cost should be considered

- Risk analysis
  - Probability of an unwanted incident
  - Risk could be in terms of
    - Changes to business
    - Resources
    - Quality of product
    - Test models unavailable
    - Testing type can't be used
    - Test environment
    - Automation
    - Tool issues
