# Testing types

- Black box testing
  - Treats software as a black box without regard to internal structure or logic of implementation
  - Concerned with external behavior
  - Objective is to identify defects in the output, generated due to a result of valid and invalid input

- White box testing
  - Factors in internal logic and structure of code
  - The test specifier uses knowledge of the internal structure of the software to derive test cases
  - Test cases cannot be determined until the code has actually been written 
  - It is testing from a developer's point of view

- Grey box testing
  - Hybrid testing
  - Involves access to internal data structures and algorithms to design test cases
  - Testing done at user or black box level

- Static Testing
