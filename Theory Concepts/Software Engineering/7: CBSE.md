# CBSE

- Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE)
  - Reuse based approach
  - Define, implement and select off-the-shelf components to form a functionality with a higher complexity
  - Allows shorter development time with increased complexity
  - Advantages of CBSE
    - Components can be used as a black box
    - Reduces development time
    - Increases quality
    - Increases productivity
  - Cons of CBSE
    - Component trustworthiness
    - Component ceritfication
    - Emergent property prediction
    - Requirement trade off
  - Essentials
    - Independent components
    - Component standards should be inlined
    - Middleware
    - Development process that is geared up to CBSE

- Software component
  - Implements a functionality without regard to where the component is executing
    - Has interfaces
    - Has dependencies
  - Standardized
  - Independent
  - Composable
  - Deployable 
  - Documented

- Component development stages
  - Development
  - Packaging
  - Distribution
  - Deployment
  - Execution

- Elements of component model
  - Interface
    - Interface definitions
    - Composition
  - Usage information
    - Globally unique name or handle
