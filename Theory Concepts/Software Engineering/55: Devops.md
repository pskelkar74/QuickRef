# DevOps

- DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices and tools that increases an organization's ability to deploy and support at high velocity

- CI involves continuously merging code written frequently
  - Reduces risk of breaking through small incremental changes

- Continuous build involves compiling, handling dependencies and involve generating an executable product
  - Sanity testing done on the build to ensure successful compilation

- Continuous Delivery is initating delivery of continuously built executables into production

- Continuous testing is the process of executing automated tests as part of the delivery pipeline to reduce wait time
  - Executed alongside CI
  - Involves testing both functional and non functional requirements

- Pillars of Devops
  - Collaboration
    - Process of building towards a specified outcome
    - Cooperation of software development and operations teams
    - Effective collaboration needs
      - Communication
      - Equal participation
      - Theory of mind (Understand others POV)
  - Affinity
    - Measure of strength
    - Build inter team relationships
    - Measured by
      - Shared time
      - Intensity of relationship
      - Reciprocity of shared stories and support
  - Tools
    - Act as an accelarator, driving change based on current culture and direction
    - Cost of collab is high, tools investment needed to lessen costs
  - Scaling
    - How the other pillars of devops can be applied in growing teams
    - Could be for
      - Organization
      - Infrastructure
      - Teams
      - Complexity
      - Workload

- Devops and AGILE
  - Devops is an approach which looks to remove the silos of development activities of building and operations activities of maintenance and deployment
    - Agile is a methodology which supports changes, reduces planning overhead and delivers products periodically
  - Devops focuses on constant testing and delivery while the Agile focuses on constant changes
  - The target area of Agile is software dev whereas the target area of Devops is to give end to end business solutions and fast delivery
  - Devops focuses more on operational and business readiness whereas Agile focuses on functional and non-functional readiness
