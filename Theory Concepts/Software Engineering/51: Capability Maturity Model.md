# Capability Maturity Model

- A maturity model can be viewed as a set of structured level that describe how well the behaviors, practices and processes of an organization can reliably and sustainably produce required outcomes

- Characterizing CMM process terminologies
  - Process
    - Set of activities, methods, practices and transformations that people use to develop and maintain software
  - Process capability
    - Ability of the process to meet specifications
  - Process performance
    - Measure of the actual results for the specific activity achieved from following a process
  - Process maturity
    - Extent to which a specific process is explicitly defined, managed, measured, controlled and is effective

- Maturity levels are a 5-level process maturity contnuum where the uppermost level is a notional ideal state where processes would be systematically managed by a combination of process optimization and continuous process improvement
  - Initial (Level 1)
    - Process is adhoc, immature, inconsistent
    - Defined processes and standard practices abandoned during crisis
    - Success depends on individual work
    - No basis for predicting quality, time for completion
  - Repeatable (Level 2)
    - Focus on basic and consistent product management processes
    - Experience in earlier projects to repeat earlier successes
    - Project management
    - Some of the KPAs are
      - Software Project Planning
      - SCM
      - SRM
      - Software subcontract management
      - SQA
  - Defined (Level 3)
    - The process for engineering and management activities are documented, standardized and integrated into a standard software process
    - Some of the KPAs considered are
      - Peer reviews
      - Intergroup coordination
      - Organization Process Definition with focus
      - Training Programs
  - Managed (Level 4)
    - Organization sets a quantitative goal for both software process and software maintenance and the performance of processes is controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques
    - The KPAs here are
      - Software quality management
      - Quantitative management
  - Optimizing (Level 5)
    - Focusing is on continually improving the process performance through both incremental and innovative technological improvements
    - KPAs here are
      - Process Change Management
      - Technology Change Management
      - Defect Prevention

- Maturity levels contain Key process areas, which identify clusters of related activities that, when performed together, achieve a set of goals. These are distinct for each level

- Goal/Focus define the intent of the areas and reflects to what extent they have been accomplished

- Benefits of a model based approach
  - Establishes common language and vision
  - Builds on a set of processes and practices developed with input from a broad section of the software community
  - Provide a framework for prioritizing actions
  - Provide a framework for performing reliable and consistent appraisals
  - Support industry wide comparisons

- Risks of Model based approach
  - Models are simplification of the real world
  - Models are not comprehensive
  - Interpretation and tailoring must be aligned to business objectives
  - Judgement is necessary to use models correctly with insight

- Limitations of CMM
  - Does not specify a way to achieve goals
  - Only helps if placed early in the software process
  - Concerned with the improvement of management

- SEI introduced few other integrated component models
  - CMMI-SE/SW integrates system engineering and software engineering
  - CMMI-SE/SW/IPPD/SS integrates system engineering, software engineering and integrated product/process and supplier sourcing engineering
  - CMMI-SE/SW/IPPD integrates system engineering, software and integrated product, process and supplier sourcing
