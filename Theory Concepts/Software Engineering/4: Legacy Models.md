# Legacy Models

- Waterfall Model
  - Requirement Analysis
  - Architecture
  - Detailed design
  - Implementation
  - Testing 
  - Deployment
  - Maintenance

- Advantages of the waterfall model
  - Simple
  - Clear phases
  - Easy to manage
  - Specific outcomes and review
- Disadvantages of the Waterfall model
  - Assumes requirements can be frozen
  - Not flexible
  - Sequential
  - No working software till late
  - High risk
  - Poor model for long projects

- V Model
  - Developer Lifecycle
    - BRS (Business Requirement Specification)
    - System Requirement Specification
    - High level design
    - Low level design
    - Implementation
  - Tester Lifecycle
    - Acceptance testing
    - System testing
    - System integration testing
    - Component Testing
    - Unit testing
  - Happens simultaneously
  - Each step in DLC corresponds to TLC

- Advantages of the V Model
  - Similar to waterfall
  - Testing can happen before coding
  - Higher probability of success
- Disadvantages of V Model
  - Similar to waterfall
  - No early prototypes
  - Change through the process needs change in testing

- Prototyping
  - Relatively cheap process
  - Instead of freezing requirements, complete prototype built to understand requirements
  - Steps
    - Requirement gathering
    - Quick design
    - Building prototype
    - Customer evaluation
    - Refining prototype
    - Engineer product

- Advantages of Prototyping
  - Active involvement of users
  - Better risk mitigation
  - Problems detected earlier
  - Missing functionality easily identified
  - Mostly stable
- Disadvantages of prototyping
  - May increase complexity of system
  - Performance may not be optimal

- Incremental Model
  - Requirements partitioned and incremental plan is made for delivery
  - Deliver partitions as they are ready
  - Each subsequent release adds functionality to the previous release
  - Steps
    - Define outline requirements
    - Assign requirements to increments
    - Design system architecture
    - Develop system increment
    - Validate increment
    - Integrate increment
    - Validate system
    - Deploy increment
  - Advantages
    - Customer value
    - More flexible
    - Easy to test and debug
    - Easy to manage risk
    - Continuous increments
    - Reduces over functionality
  - Disadvantages
    - Needs good planning and design
    - Needs clear and complete definitions
    - Total cost higher than waterfall
    - Hard to identify common facilities needed by all increments
    - Management visibility reduced
  - Usage
    - Need to get product out early
    - New technologies
    - Resources with needed skillset not available
    - High risk
    - Major requirements are defined

- Iterative Model
  - Start with a skeleton, and refine the system through feedback and evolution
  - Steps
    - Outline description
    - Requirements -> Initial version
    - Design -> Intermediate versions
    - Implementation -> Final versions
  - Advantages
    - Identifies requirements and visualisation
    - Supports risk mitigation
    - Redesign/Rework reduced
    - Incremental investment
  - Disadvantages
    - Each phase is rigid with overlaps
    - Costly system arch
  - Usage
    - Large projects

- Contrasting Incremental and Iterative Models
  - Incremental approach does not require going back when iterative does
  - Incremental focuses on things not implemented, but iterative does
  - Incremental does not leverage knowledge till then, whereas iterative learning carries forward
