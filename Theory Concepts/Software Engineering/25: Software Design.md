# Software Design

- Design is no definite formulation or completely prescriptive.
  - Process is not the same as outcome
  - Interactions between requirements engineering, architecting and design
  - No stopping rule
  - Every design problem is a symptom of another problem

- Difference between architecture and design
  - When it happens in the lifecycle
  - Architecture happens earlier and is the bigger picture, design is the smaller implementation with local constraints
  - Architecture faces towards strategy, structure and purpose. Design is tactical and faces towards implementation and practice, more concrete
  - Architecture is the structure of components, design is problem solving and planning for a solution
  - Architectural decisions are harder to change than design decisions which are simpler with lesser impact
  - Architecture has more influence on non-functional requirements, whereas design has more influence on functional requirements

- Design principles
  - Further decomposition of components
  - Identification and description of behavior of components
  - Description of how interfaces are realised
  - Description of how the system facilitates interaction with the user through UI
  - Use of appropriate structural and behavioral design patterns
  - Having maintenance and reuse as couple of its goals

- Enabling techniques
  - Abstraction
    - Ensures focus on essential properties, abstracts irrelevant detials out
    - Levels of abstraction
      - Low level : specify behavior such as data storage
      - High level : Data and relationships
  - Modularity, coupling, cohesion
    - Modularity is the extent to which a large module can be decomposed into smaller components
    - Cohesion is the extent to which modules are dependent on each other, needs to be strong
    - Coupling indicates how strongly a module is connected to others, needs to be loose
  - Information hiding
    - Hide details through specific access controls or classes
    - Seperation of interface and implementation
  - Limiting complexity
    - Amount of effort required to build the solution
    - Can be
      - Intra modular - complexity of a single module
      - Inter modular - complexity of multiple modules together
  - Hierarchical structure

- Key issues to be handled in Design
  - Concurrency
    - Parallel execution
    - Threading
    - Can give rise to deadlocks and races
  - Event handling
    - Message passing between objects
  - Hardware software mapping
    - Whether subsystems are realised in hardware or software
  - Distribution of components
    - Distributed applications are supported by middleware
    - Consider connectivity
  - Non-functional requirements
    - Some design decision not localised and has system wide impacts
  - Error, Exception handling, fault tolerance
  - Interaction and presentation
    - Reacting to user input effectively
  - Data redundancy
