# Software Maintenance Techniques

- Process acivities
  - Process implementation
  - Software maintenance life cycle
  - Migration
  - Software retirement

- Process implementation
  - Develop, document and execute maintenance plans
  - Establish procedures for handling user reports
  - Implement and establish organizational interfaces

- Software maintenance lifecycle
  - Problem identification
  - Analysis
  - Approval for change
  - Design the change
  - Implement the change
  - Review and test
  - Acceptance/Regression testing
  - Delivery patches / releases

- Migration 
  - Done by patching or new releases
  - Steps   
    - Migration plans
    - Building tools, documentation
    - Notifying users of timelines for migrations and setting expectations
    - Execute migration
    - Make available data from older product accessible
    - Provide future support for previous environment

- Software retirement
  - Plan retirement
  - Notify users of plan
  - Run retiring of older version and running new in parallel
  - Make retired data available
  - Dispose of superseded hardware and software

- Reverse engineering
  - Understand a piece of software prior to re-engineering
  - Process of recovering specification and design information about the software system from its source code
  - Identifies components and interrelationships
  - Done to create a new representation of the software
  - Does not modify existing product, nor a new product
  - Creates flow graphs

- Re-engineering
  - Modify the software to make it easier to understand
  - Considered from a maintenance perspective
  - May involve refractoring

- Restructuring
  - Maintenance for improving code quality
  - Transformation from one form to another, preserving external behavior
  - Turning dirty code to clean code
  - Reworking elements
