# Architectural Views and Styles

- Architectural View
  - Views represent ways of describing the software architecture to be viewed differently by different stakeholders
  - UI View, Process view, etc
- Architectural Style
  - How the subsystem or elements are organized or structured
  - Pipe & filters, Client-server, etc
- Architectural Patterns
  - Well known solution for a problem
  - MVC separating UI from the rest, etc

- 4 ways of viewing architectural elements
  - Structure of Modules
    - Modules of implementation with some functional responsibility
    - Structure the system as a set of code units
    - Larger modules decomposed to sub-modules may be decomposed to sub-modules
  - Component and Connector (View point)
    - Component converts input to output
    - Data element is the information needed to be processed
    - Connected element is the glue between components, such as RPCs.
    - Dynamic view of system in execution
  - Allocation view
    - Deployment structure, how software is assigned to hardware and what communication paths are used
    - Implement structure which indicates how software is mapped onto file structures in development
    - Work Assignment structure shows whos doing what and what knowledge is needed
  - Krutchens (4+1 view)
    - Use case view, exposing requirements
    - Design view, class diagrams, sequence diagrams
    - Process view, dynamic aspects and runtime behavior
    - Implementation view, realisation of the system, UML diagrams
    - Deployment view, system engineering issues

- Architectural styles
  - Pattern of organization of components in an architecture
  - Addresses structure and behavior of the system
  - Way of organizing modules
  - Provides
    - Vocabulary
      - Design elements
    - Design rules
      - Constraints
    - Semantic interpretation
      - Well defined meaning of the connected design elements
    - Analysis
      - Components and connectors
  - Some styles
    - Main program with subroutines
    - Implicit invocation
    - Pipes and filters
    - Repository
    - Layers of abstraction
    - Client Server
    - Component based system
    - Service Oriented Architecture
    - Object Oriented Architecture
