# Project Planning Steps

- Understanding the expected deliverables
  - Expectations of all stakeholders
  - Market forces driving the project
  - Looking at the high level decisions of Make-Buy-Reuse

- Planning the process
  - Choice of lifecycle based on
    - Product characteristics
    - Degree of certainty - How certain you are about the
      - Product
      - Process
      - Resource
  - Standards, Models, Guidelines, Procedures

- Organizing the project
  - Structure
    - Organisation structure
    - Context
  - Partners
    - Ecosystem partners for various phases of the project
  - Relationship of partners  
    - Upstream
    - Downstream

- Determining Deliverables
  - Buy vs Develop vs Reuse

- WBS
  - Work Breakdown Structure  
    - Split project into tasks/activities
    - Estimation of the tasks/activities
    - Estimation can be done by
      - Experience based techniques
        - Delphi
          - Everyone makes an estimate
          - Average taken
          - Everyone has done this kind of problem
        - Modified Delphi
          - Remove most conservative estimates
      - Formal techniques
        - CoCoMo - Constructive cost model  
          - Organic - Team size is small, problem is well understood, people have experience
          - Embedded - Large team size, problem is well understoof, need people with sufficient experience
          - Semi-detached - In between these two
        - Effort = a<sub>b</sub> (KiloLinesOfCode)<sup>b<sub>b</sub></sup>
        - Types of CoCoMo
          - Basic
          - Intermediate - cost drivers
          - Detailed in addition factors in dependencies

- Scheduling and Allocating resources
  - Schedule made from WBS
  - Brings all concerned people to participate in building this schedule
  - Validation of upstream and downstream dependencies
  - Task organisation and minimize dependencies
  - Costing and iterations

- Identify and Manage risks
  - Unexpected events
  - Risk management
    - Identification of risk
    - Risk assessment
    - Mitigation/Fallback
    - Identification and catching the trigger
    - Execute and monitor the mitigation plan

- Developing a quality management process
  - Plans for tracking of projects
  - Communication plans
  - Test completion
  - Beta testing
  - Staffing and people performance
  - Compensation and Benefits

- Delivery plan
  - Plans for managing the project plan
  - Procedures to be followed to release the product to customer
