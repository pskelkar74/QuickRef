# Metrics and Quality

- Measures and metrics help in quantifying the quality of products

- We need metrics because of
  - Feedback
  - Diagnostics
  - Forecasting

- An attribute is a measurable physical or abstract property of an entity

- A measure is a quantitative indication of extent, amount, dimension, capacity or size of some attribute of a product or process

- A metric is a quantitative measure of the degree to which a system, compoenent or process possesses a given attribute. It is the calculation between two measures

- Characteristics of software measures
  - Quantitative: Metrics can be expressed in values
  - Understandable: Metric computation should be easily understood
  - Applicability: Metrics should be applicable in the initial phases of development
  - Repeatable: Metric values should be the same when measured repeatedly and consistent
  - Economical: Computation must be economically
  - Language independent: Metrics should not depend on a language

- Categorization of measures
  - Direct measures
    - Internal attributes
    - Depends only on the value of the attribute
    - This is considered as valid and all other attributes are measured wrt this
  - Indirect measures
    - External attributes
    - These could be derived from the direct measures
    - Defect density, productivity

- Software metrics can also be
  - Size oriented
    - Size of software produced
  - Complex orientdd
    - LOC
    - Language and programmer dependent
    - Halstead's software science
      - Considering implementation of an algorithm to be collection of tokens, this approach counts the tokens determining which are operators and which are operands

- Software metrics can also be 
  - Product metrics
    - Assessing the state of the project
    - Tracking potential risks
    - Uncovering problem areas
    - Adjusting workflow or tasks
    - Evaluating teams ability to control quality
  - Processes metrics
    - Gaining insights of software engineering
    - Usage for long term process improvements

- How do we use metrics
  - Understand the environment/product
  - Formulate or select appropriate metrics for problem
  - Educate
  - Collect
  - Analyze
  - Interpret
  - Course correction
  - Feedback
