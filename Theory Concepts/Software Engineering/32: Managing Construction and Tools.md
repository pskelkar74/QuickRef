# Managing Construction and Tools

- Managing construction
  - Proceeding as planned?
    - Effort, expenditure and rate of completion
    - Adjust to plan based on milestone coverage
  - Technical quality?
    - Lines of code developed, number of defects found
    - Can be useful for adjusting construction plans and processes

- Construction quality
  - How easy the system is to debug
    - Measures obtained from lines of code, complexity, etc
  - Development progress and productivity
    - Active days spent, assignment scope completed, efficiency, etc

- Quality for an AGILE scrum project
  - Sprint burndown
    - Completion of work throughout the sprint based on story points
    - Consistent delivery of work
  - Team velocity metric
    - Amount of software team completes during a sprint
    - Measured in story points or hours
  - Throughput
    - Total value added work output
    - Measured in units of work
  - Cycle time
    - Total time elapsed from start date
  - Escaped defects
  - True test coverage

- Construction quality
  - Peer review
    - Checklist based reading
    - Advice from other devs
  - Unit testing
    - Test harness under a module to test the module
  - Test-first
    - Process of designing and building the test harness before writing the testing code
  - Code stepping
    - Code being tested is reviewed and executed one statement at a time, with a debugger
  - Pair programming
    - Two people working on a single piece of code
  - Debugging
  - Code inspections
    - More formal reviews
  - Static analysis
    - Examine code without executing it

- Unit testing tool
  - Unit testing frameworks
  - Code coverage analysers
    - Find code not covered in test cases
  - Wizards
    - Generate tests from input parameters
  - Record playback tools
    - Tool records every keystroke and mouse click for later replay
