# Network efficiency

- Efficient network
  - One in which overall benefits that society sees from a given network is very high

- Best network
  - One which maximises the total utility of the society (strong efficiency)

- A network g is efficient relative to a profile of utility functions if Sum(u<sub>i</sub>(g) >= Sum(u<sub>i</sub>(g'))) for all g' in G

- Pareto efficiency
  - If there exist no g' such that u<sub>i</sub>(g) >= u<sub>i</sub>(g'))
  - More reasonable when allocation rules are fixed
  - A network can Pareto dominate another network if it has strictly larger benefits for one individual and weakly larger benefits for all others
  - If there exists a network not Pareto dominated by another, it is Pareto efficient

- Distance based utility
  - The utility players receive comes from direct and indirect relationships
  - The benefit function measures the indirect benefit that players obtain from being clsoe to other players on the network
  - Distance based utility assumes all players utility functions are alike, and takes into account only indirect relationships depending on minimum path length

- Externalities
  - Show that players' benefits depend heavily on other players' commitment decisions
  - Positive: u<sub>k</sub>(g + ij) >= u<sub>k</sub>(g) if ij not in g
  - Negative: u<sub>k</sub>(g + ij) <= u<sub>k</sub>(g) if ij not in g
  - Co-Author Model
    - If a player's neighbours have many links, it brings negative externalities to them
