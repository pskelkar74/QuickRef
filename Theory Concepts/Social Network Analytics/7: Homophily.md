# Homophily

- Homophily is the tendency of individuals to associate with similar others
  - Any social characteristic leads to homophily
  - Degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are similar to each other wrt attributes
  - Makes networks contain cliques, and near-cliques (subnets which have connections between almost any two nodes within them), hence creating highly clustered networks

- Links in a social network tend to connect to people similar to each other
- Homophily may lead to commensurate distance in networks leading to creation of clusters
  - Can determine the speed of diffusion of ideas
  - Provides a illustration of how a network's surrounding contexts can drive the formation of its links
  - Can produce a division of a social network into densely connected, homogeneous parts that are weakly connected to each other

- Measuring homophily
  - If a fraction of cross-gender edges is significantly less than 2pq, then there is evidence for homophily
    - p is the probability of a node being a boy
    - q is the probability of a node being a girl
  - The number of cross-gender edges in random assignment of edges will deviate some amount from 2pq
  - Its possible to have a fraction more than 2pq, and exhibits inverse homophily

- Mechanisms underlying homophily
  - Selection: Tendency of people to form friendships based on similar characteristics
  - Social influence: People may modify their behaviors, activities, etc to bring them more closely into alignment with the behaviors of their friends
  - Interplay of social influence and selection
    - Both apply and interact with each other
