# Prisoner's Dilemma and Pareto Superior

- Prisoner's Dilemma
  - Strict dominant strategy equilibrium
  - Provides a framework to understand how to strike a balance between cooperation and competition
  - Describes a situation where two players acting strategically will ultimately result in a suboptimal choice for both
  - The scenario
    - Two suspects are apprehended for the crime and now are in seperate rooms with no means of communication
    - Prosecutor has seperately told them the following
      - If you confess and the other doesn't, the charges against you will be dropped
      - If you don't confess, but the other does, you will be convicted
      - If both of you confess, you go to prison for 2 years
      - If neither of you confesses, you both go to prison for 1 year

- Pareto Superior
  - Given an ordinal game in strategic form, let o and o' be two outcomes
  - o is strictly pareto superior to o' if every player prefers o to o'
  - o is weakly pareto superior if every player considers o to be as good as o' and atleast one player prefers o to o'
