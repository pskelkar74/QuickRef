# Auctions

- Auctions exist because
  - Many markets are imperfect
  - Hard to discover potential buyers' true valuation of your asset

- Types of auctions
  - Ascending-bid
    - Oral auction
    - All bidders initially active
    - Start price and increment fixed
    - Auctioneer calls out last price + increment
    - If atleast two bidders are active, auction proceeds
  - Descending-bid
    - Highest price kept and decreased until the first buyer accepts the price
  - First-price sealed bid
    - Blind auction
    - Bidders submit simultaneous sealed bids to the seller
    - Highest bid wins
  - Second-price sealed bid
    - Bidders submit simultaneous sealed bids to the seller
    - Pays price of second highest bid

- Reserve price: A seller specified bid level below which no sale is made
  - Thwart rings: subsets of bidders banded to not outbid each other to lower the price of the winning bid

- Economists' classification of auctions
  - Private-value
    - Every buyer knows item's valuation personally
  - Common-value
    - Item for sale has the same value to every potential buyer

- Pareto improvement is defined to be a change to a different allocation that makes atleast one individual better off without making anyone else worse off, given an initial allocation of goods

- Pareto efficiency in auctions: Sell to buyer with highest valuation (English auction with no reserve)
