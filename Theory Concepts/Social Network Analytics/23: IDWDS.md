#  Iterated Deletion of Weakly Dominated Strategies

- It is a weakening of IDSDS that it allows deletion of weakly dominated strategies
  
- In this, order of deletion matters

- The procedure is defined as
  - At every stepm identify for each player all the strategies that are weakly(or strictly) dominated and then delete all such strategies in that step
  - Produces a single strategy profile that is called the iterated weak dominant strategy equilibrium
