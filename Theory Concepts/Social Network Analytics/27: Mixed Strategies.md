# Mixed Strategies

- Pure strategy
  - Provides a complete definition of how a player will play a game
  - Determines the move a player will make for any situation they face
  - Player assigns 100% probability to one plan of action
  - Mixed strategy where one probability is 1 and the rest are 0

- Mixed strategy
  - When player does not choose one definite action/strategy, but chooses accroding to a probability distribution over his actions/strategies
  - Assignment of probability to each pure strategy
  - Each strategy is played with a fixed probability

- A totally mixed strategy is one where the player assigns a strictly positive probability to every pure strategy

- Nash equilibrium can be split into two types
  - Pure strategy Nash equilibrium : Nash equi where all players are playing pure strategies
  - Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium : Atleast one player is playing a mixed strategy, and no player can increase expected payoff with an alternate strategy

- Every finite game has a Nash equilibrium, not all have pure strategy Nash equilibrium
  - Games can have both pure and mixed strategy equilibria

- In 2x2 games
  - Each pure strategy in a mixed strategy equi pays the same at equilibrium
  - In equi, each player's probability distribution makes all others indifferent between their pure strategies
