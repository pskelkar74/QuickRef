# Pareto and Zipf's Law

- There are two variants of the Power law
  - Pareto law (80-20 rule / Golden ratio)
  - Zipf's law

- Pareto Law
  - 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes, asserting an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs
  - Things in life are not distributed equally
  - Advantages
    - Guide to allocate resources efficiently
    - It can give a window into who to reward or what to fix
  - Focus effort on the 20% that makes a difference, rather than the 80% that doesn't add much
  - Disadvantages
    - Doesn't always mean its true
    - Merely an observation, and not a law

- Zipf's Law
  - Emprical law explaining that natural and artificial systems often exhibit a surprising degree of statistical regularity
  - Relation between rank order and frequency of occurence
  - When observations are ranked by their frequency, the frequency is inversely proportional to it's rank
  - Holds only on average, not exactly
  - Refers to the size y of an occurence of an event relative to it's rank r
  - States that the size of the r'th largest occurence of the event is inversely proportional to it's rank

- Difference between the laws
  - Zipf: Rank on horizontal axis, frequency on vertical. Pareto did the opposte
