# Pairwise Nash Stability

- An Extensive Form Game of Network Formation
  - Players move sequentially and propose links which are accepted or rejected
  - Decision to form a link is binding and cannot be undone
  - Reconsidering decisions in a voting process is allowed
  - The game continues to move through remaining unformed links in order till all links are formed or no new links are formed
  - Main drawbacks
    - Game can be very difficult o solve
    - Ordering of links can have substantial impact

- Simultaneous Link Announcement 
  - Each player announces his preferred set of players
  - Players linked if they both name each other
  - A network is Nash stable if it results from a pure strategy Nash equi of the link announcement game
  - Main drawback is the game may have too many Nash equilibria
  - Nash equilibrium allows players to refuse to form links, but does not capture the fact that it may be mutually advantageous for two players to form a new relationship

- A network g is Nash stable iff no player wants to delete some set of his or her links

- Pairwise stability restricts attention to changes of one link at a time
  - A nework is pairwise Nash stable if it is both pairwise stable and Nash stable
