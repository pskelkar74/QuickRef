# Game Strategies

- Strict dominance
  - We say A strictly dominates B if, for every strategy profile of the other players, strategy A of player 1 in conjuction with all other players' strategies, yields a payoff for player 1 which is greater than payoff of strategy B

- Weak dominance
  - A weakly dominates B if, for every possible strategy profile of the other players, strategy A of player 1 yields a payoff greater than or equal to the payoff for strategy B

- A is a strictly dominant strategy if A strictly dominates every other strategy for a player i.

- A is a weakly dominant strategy if choosing it always gives an outcome that is as good as or better than an alternative strategy

- A strict/weak dominant strategy equilibrium is if, for every player i, A is a strictly/weakly dominant strategy
