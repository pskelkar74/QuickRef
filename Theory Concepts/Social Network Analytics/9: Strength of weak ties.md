# Strength of weak ties

- Interpersonal ties are defined as information carrying connections between people
  - Come in 2 varieties: Strong and Weak
  - Strong tie: Someone you know well
  - Weak tie: More tenuous relationship

- What distinguishes a strong tie from a weak tie
  - Age of relationship
  - Frequency of contact
  - Emotional attachment
  - Reciprocity
  - Kinship

- Bridges
  - Connect two distinct connected components
  - This edge is the only route between its endpoints

- Local bridges
  - If endpoints don't have any friends in common
  - If deleting this edge would increase the distance between A and B to a value strictly more than two
  - When it does not form a side of any triangle in a graph

- Strong triadic closure
  - If a node has strong ties to two neighbours, then these neighbours must have atleast a weak tie between them
  - Granovetter suggested
    - Node A violates the property if it has ties to two other nodes B and C and there is no edge between B and C
  
- If a node A in a network satisfies the strong triadic closure property and is involved in at least two strong ties, then any local bridge it is involved in must be a weak tie
  - The local bridges in a network are necessarily weak ties
  - Granovetter says: All bridges are weak ties

- The more weak ties we have
  - More connected to the world we are
  - More likely to receive important information about ideas, threats and opportunities in time to respond to them

- Weak ties are responsible for
  - Majority of the embeddedness and structure of social networks
  - Transmission of information through the networks
