# Introduction to Game Theory

- Game theoretic models are very natural for modeling social networks
  - Social network nodes are rational, intelligent
  - They form in a decentralized way
  - Strategic interaction among social network nodes

- Game theory is the study of ways in which interacting choices of economic agents produce outcomes wrt the preferences of those agents, where the outcomes in question might have been intended by none of the agents
  - Study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers

- Game theory focuses on interaction among intelligent, sophisticated and rational individuals
  - Nature of players varies depending on the context

- Game theory types
  - Cooperative vs Non-cooperative Games
    - In cooperative games, participants can establish alliances to maximise their winning chance
    - Players are convinced to adopt a strategy through cooperation and negotiations
    - Non-cooperative game theory models situations where the players are either unable to communicate or able to communicate without binding contracts
  - Symmetric vs Asymmetric Games
    - In symmetric games, strategies adopted by all players are the same
    - Symmetry can exist in short term games only because in long term games the number of options with a player increases
    - Asymmetric games are the one in which strategies adopted by the players are different
    - Strategies can vary in benefits and decision making depends on these strategies
  - Perfect vs Imperfect Information Games
    - Perfect information games are when all players can see the other players moves
    - Imperfect games do not show the other players moves
  - Simultaneous and Sequential games
    - Simultaneous games are games with both players playing simultaneously with no knowledge of each others moves
    - Sequential games allow knowledge of the players moves played one after the others
    - Simultaneous games are represented in normal form while sequential games are represented in extensive form
  - Normal Form and Extensive form games
    - Normal form games are games in the form of matrices, that help identify dominated strategies and the Nash equilibrium
    - Extensive form games are denoted by decision trees, and represent events that can happen by chance
  - Constant Sum, Zero Sum and Non-Zero Sum Games
    - Constant sum games are where the sum of the outcomes of all players remain constant even if the outcomes are different
    - Zero sum game is a constant sum game with the sum = 0
      - Strategies of players cannot affect resources
      - Gain of one player is the loss of the other
    - Nonzero sum games are games where the sum of the outcomes is non zero
      - Can be turned to zero sum by adding one dummy player, with the loss of the dummy are overriden by the net earnings of the players
