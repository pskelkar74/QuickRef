# Diffusion

- The spreading of something more widely through a network is called diffusion

- The patterns by which epidemics spread through a society is determined not just by the properties of the pathogen carrying it, but also by the network structure within the population
  - Opportunities for a disease to spread from one person to another is given by the contact network, indicating who has contact with whom on a regular basis

## Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory
- Explains how, over time, an idea or behavior gains momentum and diffuses through a specific population or social system
- Adoption is a person doing something differently than he had previously
- The key to adoption is that the person must perceive the idea as new or innovative
- when promoting an innovation, it is important to understand the characteristics of the target population that will help or hinder adoption of the innovation

- DOI proposes that four main elements influence the spread of a new idea
  - Innovation
  - Communication channels
  - Time
  - Social system

- Process relies heavily on human capital

- Innovation must be widely adopted to self-sustain
  - Within the rate of adoption, innovation reaches critical mass

- There are 5 established adopter categories
  - Innovators
    - First to try the innovation
    - Interested in new ideas
    - Take risk, and develop new ideas
  - Early adopters 
    - Opinion leaders
    - Leadership roles and change opportunities
    - They are aware of the need to change and are comfortable adopters
    - Don't need info to convince them to change
  - Early majority
    - Adopt ideas before the average person
    - Need evidence to see innovation works
  - Late majority
    - Skeptical of change
    - Adopt only after majority has tried it
    - Need evidence of majority success
  - Laggards
    - Conservative and bound by tradition
    - Highly skeptical
    - To appeal, need stats, appeals and pressure from other adopters

- The stages by which a person adopts an innovation include
  - Awareness of the need for an innovation
  - Decision to adopt/reject the innovation
  - Initial use of the innovation to test
  - Continued use of the innovation

- The five main factors that influence adoption of an innovation are
  - Relative advantage
  - Compatibility
  - Complexity
  - Triability
  - Observability

## The Bass Models

- How many customers will eventually adopt the new product and when?

- Basic principle
  - Adopters can be
    - Innovators
      - Not influenced in the timing of their initial purchase by number of buyers
    - Imitators
      - Influenced by number of previous buyers
  - Speed and timing of adoption depends on 
    - Their degree of innovativeness
    - The degree of imitation among adopters

- Bass Model 1
  - d F(T)/dt = [p + q F(t)] (1 - F(t))
  - Innovation coefficient (p)
    - Represents innovation in the population
    - Extent to which adopters are influenced by their own intrinsic tendency to innovate and by factors beyond the population
    - Rate of innovation
  - Imitation coefficient (q)
    - Represents the extent to which the adopters emulate other members of the same population
    - Rate of imitation
  - F(t)
    - Denotes fraction of agents who have adopted a product at a time t
  - Lower the value of p, the longer it takes to realise sales growth for innovation
  - When both p and q are large, product sales take off rapidly and fall off after reaching a maximum
  - By varying p and q, different diffusion results are observed

- Bass Model 2
  - Solves the Bass model 1 equation
