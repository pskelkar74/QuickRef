# Background and Fundamentals of Network Analysis

- Types of SNA
  - Egocentric SNA
    - Focuses on individual
    - Understands structure and function of network ties around an individual
  - Sociocentric SNA
    - Focuses ona group
    - Quantifies relationships between people ina group
    - Knowing network boundary and actors is important

- Egocentric Networks
  - Consists of
    - Focal node: Ego
    - Nodes connected directly to the ego: Alter
    - Ties, if any, among the alters

- Levels of Egocentric Networks
  - Level 1.0: Ego and alters
  - Level 1.5: Includes alters and any ties between these alters
  - Level 2.0: Includes all alter connections, and not just the alters the ego knows

- Why study Ego networks
  - Information
  - Social support
  - Access to resources
  - Influence
  - Etc
- All of the above influence the Ego's behavior

- Egocentric data use
  - Name generator
    - Survey item that collects ego's alters
    - End result is a list of alters
  - Name interpreter
    - Collects alters characteristics
    - Nature of relationship
    - Attributes of the alter


- Characteristics of Ego Networks
  - Strong ties are homophilious
  - People with heterogeneous networks are "better off"
  - According to Granovetter, the stronger the tie between Ego and two of her alters, the greater the likelihood that the alters enjoy atleast a weak tie
  - Granovetter also believes that weak ties provide people with access to novel information, whereas your strong ties tend to know the same things you do. This makes the ego network more insular and homogeneous.

- Ego network measures are based on
  - Ego-alter ties
    - Tie multiplexity
      - Ego and alter have how many relationships
      - High multiplexity ties have more motivation to be maintained
    - Tie strength
      - Presence of strong ties - integration
      - Presence of weak ties - access to novel resources
  - Alter attributes
    - Reflects content/character
    - Social influence
    - Access to social capital
    - Broader patterns of interaction in society
  - Alter-Alter ties    
    - Ties maybe binary or valued
    - Structural holes (absence of tie between two alters) is characterised

- Typical Ego network measures
  - Homophily
    - Provides measures of each ego's homophily with its alters based on a specific attribute
    - It refers to correlation between ego attributes and alter attributes
  - Size (Same as degree)
    - More alters represents more popularity
  - Strength of ties
  - Composition
    - How many of X kind of alters are in ego's network neighbourhood
    - If composition is homogeneity - Are ego's alters all alike?
    - If composition is heterogeneity - Provides access to a larger set of non redundant social resources

- Structural Analyses
  - Structural Holes
    - Absence of ties between alters
    - Finding and exploiting a structural hole can give an entrepreneur a competitive advantage
  - Alters are non-redundant when they have no direct connection with one another, creating a structural hole.
  - Lack of ties among alters may benefit ego
    - Control
    - Autonomy
    - Information

- Data Formats
  - Column wise
    - Data organized in one matrix
    - Each row corresponds to a specific ego
    - Columns correspond to
      - ego attributes
      - alter attributes
      - ego-alter ties and perceptions
      - alter-alter relationships
