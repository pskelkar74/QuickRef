# Background and Fundamentals of Network Analysis

- Characteristics of Ego Networks
  - Strong ties are homophilious
  - People with heterogeneous networks are "better off"
  - According to Granovetter, the stronger the tie between Ego and two of her alters, the greater the likelihood that the alters enjoy atleast a weak tie
  - Granovetter also believes that weak ties provide people with access to novel information, whereas your strong ties tend to know the same things you do. This makes the ego network more insular and homogeneous.

- Ego network measures are based on
  - Ego-alter ties
    - Tie multiplexity
      - Ego and alter have how many relationships
      - High multiplexity ties have more motivation to be maintained
    - Tie strength
      - Presence of strong ties - integration
      - Presence of weak ties - access to novel resources
  - Alter attributes
    - Reflects content/character
    - Social influence
    - Access to social capital
    - Broader patterns of interaction in society
  - Alter-Alter ties    
    - Ties maybe binary or valued
    - Structural holes (absence of tie between two alters) is characterised

- Typical Ego network measures
  - Homophily
    - Provides measures of each ego's homophily with its alters based on a specific attribute
    - It refers to correlation between ego attributes and alter attributes
  - Size (Same as degree)
    - More alters represents more popularity
  - Strength of ties
  - Composition
    - How many of X kind of alters are in ego's network neighbourhood
    - If composition is homogeneity - Are ego's alters all alike?
    - If composition is heterogeneity - Provides access to a larger set of non redundant social resources

- Structural Analyses
  - Structural Holes
    - Absence of ties between alters
    - Finding and exploiting a structural hole can give an entrepreneur a competitive advantage
  - Alters are non-redundant when they have no direct connection with one another, creating a structural hole.
  - Lack of ties among alters may benefit ego
    - Control
    - Autonomy
    - Information
