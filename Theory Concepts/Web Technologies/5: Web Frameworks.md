# Web Frameworks

A framework is a structure of a framework. It is a software framework to support the development of web applications. 
Core components of web applications are:
- Database
- API logic
- Front end
- Internet
- Browser
- Media cache

More broadly, it has three main types
- UI
- Request Layer
- Backend

A framework provides the implementation of the core functionality. Main goals of a framework are
- Allow function based processing
- Different functions from different URLs
- Allow ORMs
- Session Management
- Authentication
- Security

Classification
- Microsoft
- Java Based
- Python based
- PHP based
- Ruby based
- Javascript based

Productivity of Frameworks is given by
- Pace of development
- Ease of maintaining and enhancing code
- Best development practices
- Opinionated vs Non-opinionated
  - Opinionated: Do it the frameworks way
  - Non opinionated: Do it your way
- Inbuilt testing frameworks

Framework calls your code, whereas your code calls a library. The framework contains library.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) enforces that application logic is seperate from business logic
- Model: Structures your data in a reliable form and prepares it based on controllers
- View: Displays data to user in easy format
- Controller: Layer between model and view that handles requests and responses between the model and view.

MVC has two models
1. Push based
2. Pull based

Advantages:
- Seperation of concerns
- Developer specialisation and focus
- Parallel development by seperate teams

Disadvantages of MVC:
- Complexity
- Can affect performance
- You may be using non MVC code in project
- Additional Resource Usage

The Object Relational Mapping model
- It tells the programmer to only write the business logic, update instances, and the ORM takes care of updating the database
- It gives faster applications and abstraction between SQL engines
