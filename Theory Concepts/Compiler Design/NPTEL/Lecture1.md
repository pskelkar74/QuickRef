# Lecture 1 - Introduction to Compilers

- Compilers usually translate one representation of code to another
  - They maintain and preserve essence and integrity of code
  - Check errors
  - Optimize the code given

- Source code and machine code mismatch in the abstractions provided by the source language, and the compiler resolves these abstractions by translation
- Goals of translation
  - Good performance for generated code
  - Good compile time performance
  - Maintainable code
  - High level of abstraction
  - Correctness is preserved

- The common elements of a program execution life cycle are
  - Editor
  - Compiler
  - Assembler
  - Linker
  - Loader
  - Debugger
