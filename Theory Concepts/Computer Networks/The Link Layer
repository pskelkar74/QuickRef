The Link Layer

There are two fundamentally different types of link-layer channels

1. Broadcast Channels 
    
    These connect multiple hosts in wireless LANs, satellite networks and HFC networks. A medium access protocol is needed to coordinate frame transmission. This can be a central controller, or the hosts can themselves be used to coordinate transmissions.

2. Point-to-Point Communication Links

    Often found between long-range routers, or between ethernet switches and end systems. This usually uses the PPP.


Node: Any device that runs a link-layer protocol
Links: Communication channels that connect adjacent nodes
