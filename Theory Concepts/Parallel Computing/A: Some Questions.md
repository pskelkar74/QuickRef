# C++11 Parallel Constructs

## Preface

The main goal is to introduce to you
1. Parallel computing in imperative programming languages and C++ in particular, and
2. Real-world performance and efficiency in writing parallel software and techniques for dealing with them.

The PASL library is used, which uses advanced scheduling techniques to run parallel programs efficiently on modern multicores and provides a range of utilities to understand the behavior of parallel programs.

PASL stands for Parallel Algorithm Scheduling Library.
