# Blockchain Key Concepts

- Nodes
  - Runs blockchain software
  - Keeps network healthy
  - Solves complex problems for adding blocks
  - Stores history of the network as a local copy
  - Generally three types of nodes
    - Full node
      - Downloads all blocks and transactions to local storage
      - Fully independent
      - Provides blocks and transactions to other ndoes
      - Can get new blocks and transactions from other nodes
      - Can verify all blocks
      - Does not need to have a pair of public/private keys, if the node only reviews the network
      - It does not need to run proof-of-work
      - Mining is a process of confirming transactions by finding a hash that meets defined difficulty
    - Light node
      - Light client/Lightweight client
      - Only care about own node's transactions
      - Done to save space and time
      - Uses Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) to verify transactions
      - This contains a pair of public/private keys
      - It does not connect to the blockchain network directly, rather it relies on a full node
      - It cannot verify all blocks
      - A full node that a light node relies on can see all transactions and balances of the light node
    - Miner
      - Helps create blocks for a blockchain
      - Uses ASIC (Application specific integrated circuits) for mining
      - Based on how and where mining is done, can be of three types
        - Solo: connects with the network directly
        - Pool: Group of miners work together
        - Cloud: Mining hardware placed in datacenters with capacity sold to miners
    - Public nodes
      - No gating mechanism or licensing fees
    - Permissioned blockchain nodes
      - No native cryptocurrency
      - No mining
    - Corda nodes
      - R3 based distributed ledgers
    - HFC nodes
      - Called peers and orderers
      - Host ledger data and make sure its in order
      - Fabric peers can host more than one blockchain ledger
    - Federated blockchain nodes
      - User of a system elects nodes to process transactions
      - Reduces cost but increases updates and transaction clearance speed

- A ledger is a general ter used for describing records used to account for something

- Factom
  - Public blockchain with 2 classes of federated nodes
  - Half process transactions and half verify integrity
  - Has native cryptocurrency but no mining
  - Federated nodes rewarded with factoids

- Waves
  - Public blockchain
  - Has nodes that hold sufficient waves of cryptocurrency
  - Peer-to-peer
  - Validate transactions + History = Waves node

- Tokens
  - Digital asset
  - Programmable assets or access rights
  - Its managed by a smart contract
  - It serves as an underlying distirbuted ledger
  - Available to the person who has the private access key

- Token categories
  - Work or utility based tokens
    - Access right to contribute to a network and receive rewards
    - Can be exchanged for a service/product
  - Asset based tokens
    - Gives holders equity in your ventures
    - Can lay claims to profit and revenue
    - Has to pass the Howey test
  - Security based tokens
    - Backed by tangible assets
    - Represents physical assets

- Token types
  - ERC-20
    - Ethereum network
    - Crowdfunding token
    - Fungible and tradeable
  - ERC 721
    - Main use in digital collectibles
    - Non fungible
  - ERC 1411
    - Security tokens
    - Third party responsible for authorising transfer
    - Auth managed through smart contracts

- A traditional security token protocol stack
  - Exchange
    - The Ocean
    - Sharepost
    - Airswap
    - Provide a venue for liquidity
  - Exchange protocol
    - 0x
    - Swap
    - Ensures global liquidity pool
  - Compliance platform
    - Hardbor
    - Off chain processes that conduct issuer due diligence, ensure that investors are qualified to participate in offerings and later trades
  - Token
    - R-Token (ERC20)
    - Security token ensures onchain compliant transactions
  - Blockchain
    - Ethereum

- Security Token blockchain flow
  - Company issues digital tokens for it stocks
  - People purchase and pass these tokens around
  - Every transaction is recorded on a blockchain
  - The blockchain and tokens provide ownership information
  - The company determines dividend payment

- The main difference between a token and a coin is that tokens are created with coloured coins, and coins are generated by a consensus algorithm

- The different ledgers that came up in design are
  - Single entry ledger
    - A one sided entry in either the credit column or the debit column
  - Double entry ledger
    - Tracks debits and credits
    - Both parties have a private ledger

- Blockchain features
  - Immutable ledgers
  - Synchronized access across different sites
  - Replaces central authority
  - Cyber attacks minimised

- Types of public ledgers
  - Public blockchain ledger
  - Private blockchain ledger

- How it works
  - User requests for a transaction
  - A block representing the transaction is created
  - A block is broadcasted to all nodes in the network
  - All the nodes validate the block
  - Block is added to the chain
  - Transaction is verified and executed

- Key features
  - Anonymity
  - Immutability
  - Peer-to-peer
  - Distributed
  - Transparency
  - Logical Computation
