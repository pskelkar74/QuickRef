# Decentralised Autonomous Organizations

- A DAO is a sophisticated smart contract
  - Do more than just transfer of value
  - Have voting righs of members
  - The bylaws of the DAO are secured directly in the blockchain
  - Done to solve the principal agent problem
    - Agent can make decisions on behalf of another but is influenced by his own self interest
    - Agent may choose to take more risk because they dont have to carry the cost of the risk
  - DAOs allow people to collaborate and agree on courses of action within rules

- DAOs can be used to overcome "The tragedy of the commons"
  - Self interest depletes or destroys a natural resource

- Working of DAOs
  - Run through rules encoded within their smart contracts. Completely online but can have assets offline
  - Allow two parties to cooperate on interests
  - A deployed DAO is autonomous
  - DAOs rely on tokens to gain cooperation
  - Public blockchains need to reach a critical mass of decentralisation to withstand things like a mining pool being attacked
    - This is when a pool of miners will rotate quickly from blockchain to another to optimize harvest and selling cryptocurrency
    - These are damaging as they drive down cryptocurrencty cost and can leave the blockchain stalled

- Key takeaways
  - All of a DAOs transactions are recorded in its blockchain
  - DAOs gain consensus by having their members vote on important issues such as movement of funds
  - Many contracts give voting windows to not hold up actions

- Differences b/w traditional organizations and DAO architecture
  - DAOs involve a self enforced protocol, so nothing goes wrong legally
  - Keeping the network safe yields rewards
  - Cost of management is low and transperancy is high
  - No bilateral agreements - everything is governed by the protocol

- Advantages
  - More trust
  - All information stored in the blockchain ledger
  - Making own decisions

- Disadvantages
  - Trust factor due to human error in engineering smart contracts
