  - Independent storage is created where A and B can put values but cannot remove any
  - B puts money for rent in storage
  - A puts the address and the code to her apartment in storage
  - A gets payment confirmation and B receives the address and code
  - If B goes to location and code is right, A gets the payment
  - If code is wrong, B gets his money back
  - If B doesnt come to location, A gets liquidated damages payment and B gets the rest
  - At the end, contract is fulfilled
