# Blockchain Models

- Types of blockchain
  - Private model
  - Public model
  - Hybrid model
  - Consortium model

- Public blockchain
  - Permissionless
  - Anyone can read and write to the ledger
  - Complete decentralization
  - Any user can add smart contracts without intervention from developers
  - Steps
    - Buyer creates a transaction or a block
    - Transaction is distributed and validated via cryptographic hashing
    - Transaction is committed to blockchain and miners are rewarded
    - Trustless peering sends the transaction to receiver

- Private blockchain
  - Maintains access control
  - User identity known to veeryone
  - Steps
    - Buyer creates a transaction or a block
    - Transaction is distributed and validated via cryptographic hashing
    - Transaction is controlled by consortia
    - Trusted peering forwards transaction to seller

- Hyperledger private blockchains work as
  - Application SDK submits proposal to endorsing peer
  - Endorsing peer executes chaincode to simulate proposal in peer
    - Query state DB for reads
    - Build RWSet
  - Send proposal response back with SWset to SDK
  - SDK submits transaction
  - Ordering service creates batch (block) of transactions
  - Committing peers receive bactch of transactions from ordering service
  - Committing peers validate each transaction and commit block
    - Validate endorsement policy (VSCC)
    - Validate ReadSet versions in state DB (MVCC)
    - Commit block to blockchain
    - Commit valid trans to state DB

- Consortium Blockchain
  - Association or a group of organizations
  - Shared blockchain among the group

- Hybrid Blockchain
  - Steps
    - Data undergoes algorithmic transformation to a public key
    - The key generates a hash
    - This hash and timestamp is verified on the public network
