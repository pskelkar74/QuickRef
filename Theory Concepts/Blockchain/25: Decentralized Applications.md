# Decentralised applications

- More flexible, transperant, distributed, resilient and have a better incentivized structure than current software models
  - Work with cryptographically stored ledger
  - Scarce asset model, and peer to peer technology
  - Runs in a distributed manner

- Advantages of Dapps
  - Faster processing
  - High security
  - Greater anonymity
  - Reliability

- Features of Dapps
  - OpenSource
  - Decentralized
  - Incentivized
  - Protocol

- Dapps work in a different way compared to Front end -> API -> Database
  - Frontend has a wallet to communicate with the blockchain
  - Wallet manages crypto keys and blockchain address
  - Public key is used for user ID and auth
  - Instead of API, wallet triggers activities of a smart contract, that interacts with the blockchain
