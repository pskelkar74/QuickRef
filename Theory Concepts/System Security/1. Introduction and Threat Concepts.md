# Introduction and Threat Concepts

- Security is about achieving a goal when an adversary is present.
  - Policy to enforce (Goal)
    - Confidentiality
    - Integrity
    - Availability
  - Threat Model
    - Set of assumptions about the adversary
  - Mechanisms
    - Software/Hardware for implementation
- We have to make sure security policy is followed regardless of the power of the adversary
- Every iteration identifies a new threat link to the system

## Policies

- Examples: Recovery questions
- Recovery questions changed the policy of the system
- Instead of needing password, you can know password or security questions
- Be conservative about your policy

## Threat Models

- Human factors
  - Human assumptions - Will pick a strong password, etc
- Make sure assumptions keep up with time

## Mechanisms

- Example: Apple iCloud's different mechanisms for different interfaces
- Expose the same policy at all interfaces
