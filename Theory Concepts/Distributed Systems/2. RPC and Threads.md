# RPC and Threads

- Go is used traditionally
  - Good RPC callbacks
  - Garbage collected
  - Harder to mess with underlying memory
  - Simple to use

- Threads
  - Provides concurrency
  - Called goroutines in Go

- Why use threads
  - I/O concurrency
    - Provided by threads
    - Can have one program with multiple RPCs waiting for results
  - Parallelism
    - Run threads on multiple cores
  - Convenience

- When sharing memory between threads, a lot of bugs can occur
  - Race conditions
  - Coordination is necessary
    - Channels in Go
    - Condition variables
    - Mutexes
    - WaitGroups in Go

- Deadlocks occur when one thread waits for a thread waiting for the first thread
