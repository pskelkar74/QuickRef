# Introduction to Distributed Systems

- Reasons to go distributed
  - Parallelism
  - Fault Tolerance
  - Physicality
  - Security and isolation

- Challenges - CAP Theorem
  - Concurrency
  - Availability
  - Partial Failure
  - It is impossibe for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two of the three following guarantees

- Major infrastructures in distributed systems  
  - Storage
  - Communication
  - Computation

- Implementations used
  - Remote Procedural Calls
  - Threads
  - Concurrency control

- Performance standpoint
  - Scalability optimized
  - Scaling up and scaling out is not infinite

- Fault tolerance
  - Availability
  - Recoverability

- Consistency
  - Maybe two servers have different values for the same key
  - Strong
    - Update all copies of the key
    - More bandwidth
  - Weak
    - Lazy updates to distributed servers
    - Less bandwidth

- MapReduce
  - Assuming input is split into chunks
  - Map produces a set of (k,v) pairs
  - A shuffler shuffles the data by key
  - Reduce processes the (k,v) pairs and aggregates the value per key
  - Each map or reduce is called a task, and overall the process is called a job
