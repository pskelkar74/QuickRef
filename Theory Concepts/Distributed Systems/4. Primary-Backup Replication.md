# Primary-Backup Replication

- Failures due to no replication
  - Fail-stop failure of a single computer
    - If something goes wrong, computer just stops executing
  - Hardware defects

- What replication does not fix
  - Bugs in package
  - Failures in primary and backup may not be independent

- Approaches to replication
  - State Transfer
    - Transfer memory
    - More robust in multicore transfers
  - Replicated State Machine
    - Transfer ops
    - Preferred as sending ops is smaller
    - But is more complicated and relies on assumptions

- To build an RSM
  - How do we represent state?
  - How closely do the backup and primary need to be synced?

- Non deterministic events
  - Inputs from external sources
    - Packets
    - Data + Interrupts
  - Weird instructions
