The cloud imperative is the idea of using the cloud in a responsible, agile and sophisticated matter for your applications. The cloud is an abstraction made to connect datacenters together, regardless of HOW the data is actually transferred. Animoto used cloud services on Rightscale to create plugins to allow photos to be strung together to form a video. Edufi is a sports coaching service networking athletes and coaches, using the cloud.

Everything popular in technology goes away after certain times. Today's world is centralised, and the central cloud does all this processing. The change is the advent of edge computing, with IoT. The data drives the change, and realtime data is what is the key, and edge computing leverages this realtime data the fastest. Machine learning unlocks the power of edge computing. At the edge, sensing, inference and actions occur. The learning however, occurs at the cloud. Sensor/data explosion will kill the cloud, where devices are going to return to a P2P version. We are going to move into data-centric programming, where there is less codem but more math. The processing power of the edge will increase, decreasing the pricing of the cloud.

The cloud has been gaining interest due to the revenues generated in the field. Google Cloud is changing the core competency for Google from being an advertising company to a public cloud provider.

The motivation for using cloud models in heterogeneous applications is very useful. For this, we need a cloud infrastructure natively designed to handle this heterogeinity, without compromising on UI/UX. Openstack follows a simple pattern to involve flavour scheduling for heterogeneous infrastructures. A hybrid environment here, includes both physical and virtual resources. Some scenarios that demonstrate the strength of this is
1. Node repurposing - dynamically manage virtual and physical pools
2. Runtime decision on target pool - don't specify target for deployment, and the system automatically makes the decision of target for you.

Integrated management allows the hybrid environment with bare-metal machines and virtualised machines.

For an attacker, the data is important, and not the service that interacts with the data. A lot of the data can come by the DNS records, mainly from MX records. These attacks are based on the authentication level.
