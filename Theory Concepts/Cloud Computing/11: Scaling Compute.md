# Scaling Compute

- Compute system scale as requests increase
- First take a SQL database, then shift towards NoSQL when users increase, as
  - low latency
  - Unrelational data
  - Metadata driven datasets
  - Schema less data constructs
  - Massive amounts of data ingestion
- Elastic Load balancing in AWS provides redundancy and lack of failover
- Reverse proxy
  - Scale out vs Scale up
  - Provides firewall and health monitoring
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  - Provides auto deploy, load balancing and scaling
  - Also gives reverse proxy
- Load can be shifted around as 
  - Static content from web instance to S3 and CloudFront
  - Dynamic content from ELB to CloudFront
  - Move session/state and DB caching to ElastiCache or Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon CloudFront
  - Scalable content delivery
  - Cache static content on the edge
  - Zone apex support
  - Low TTLs
  - Low cost
- Elasticity - AutoScaling
  - Ability of a system to dynamically adapt its underlying computing infrastructure resources in response to variable workload changes
  - Horizontal scaling
    - More computing resources
    - Growing management complexity
  - Vertical scaling
    - Bigger compute
    - Single point of failure
  - Rule based scaling
    - Monitor resources and trigger adding or releasing compute based on thresholds
