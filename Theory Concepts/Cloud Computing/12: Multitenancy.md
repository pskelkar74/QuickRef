  - Most complex: Single version of software hosted on cluster
- Database methods
  - Dedicated tables per client
    - Each tenant has their own tables
    - Store different tables in different files for security
  - Shared tables per client
    - All data on same table
    - Each row has tenant ID
    - Space efficient
    - Can use keys for encryption and added metadata
- Customizations, say different fields per tenant
  - Pre-allocated columns
    - Pre defined custom columns per row
    - Metadata stores info about the custom columns
  - Name-value pairs
    - Main table has name-value pair record column
    - Pivot table has list of name-value pairs
    - Greater space efficiency
    - Joins needed to reconstruct records
