# The PaaS Programming Model - Microsoft Azure

The Azure Services Platform is a popular application platform for the cloud that allows Windows applications and web services to be hosted and run in Microsoft datacenters.
It also provides a Data-as-a-Service and IaaS, along with its native PaaS feature.

Developers in Azure need not manage or create VMs explicitly. Applications are written either as Web Roles and/or Worker roles, and tells the Azure bench the number of instances of each role to be created. The Web Role mirrors Web applications hosted on .NET systems. The Worker role mirrors the heavy duty processing elements.
