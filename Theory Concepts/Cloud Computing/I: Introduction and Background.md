# Introduction and Background to Cloud Computing

## The Evolution of the Web

Web 1.0 arrived in the 1990s, where the user could click hyperlinks to get additional information, where information was strictly one way, from institutions maintaining websites to users.

Google and other search engines served as catalogs for these webpages, and enterprises constantly put up their own websites for information about them.

The second wave, called Web 2.0 developed in the early 2000s, where applications that allowed users to upload things on the Web became popular, allowing rapid growth of user generated content, social networking and crowd sourcing.

This led to an explosion of information crowdsourced from users, and the information doubled every 18 months. Businesses mined this information to increase profitability and this information also allowed networking.

Another major change was the rapid growth in mobile devices, and the advent of mobile internet access. These allowed better user experience and application usage spiked.

Extrapolation led to the advent of Cloud, where cloud platforms harness large amounts of computing power to analyse large amounts of data. This allows more sophisticated applications that can analyse data stored in the clouds in smarter ways.

Wisdom of crowds is a model used for better decision making in cloud environments, where the beliefs of indiviuals are aggregated to make better decisions than a single individual.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is delivering Internet at scale. Compute, storage, networking and infrastructure as well as development and deploymens are made available on-demand.

<b>Cloud computing is a model for enabling <u>ubiquitous</u>, convenient, <u>on-demand</u> network access to a <u>shared pool</u> of configurable computing resources that can be <u>rapidly provisioned</u> and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.</b>

NIST specifies the following five essential characteristics that a CC infrastructure must have
1. On demand self-service
   1. Self-provisioned or autoprovisioned
2. Broad Network Access
3. Resource Pooling
4. Rapid elasticity - increase or decrease compute power
5. Measured service - pay as you go

## Cloud Deployment Models

NIST defines four deployment models for clouds
1. Private Cloud
   1. A private cloud is a CC infrastructure that is built for a single enterprise.
2. Public Cloud
   1. A public cloud is a cloud infrastructure owned by a cloud service provider that provides cloud services to the public for commercial services
3. Community Cloud
   1. A community cloud is a cloud infrastructure shared by a community of multiple organizations, generally with a common purpose.
4. Hybrid Cloud
   1. Hybrid clouds are mixtures of these different deployments.

### Private vs Public Clouds

1. The private cloud model utilises the in-house infrastructure to host different cloud services. The cloud user here typically owns the infrastructure. The infrastructure for the public cloud is usually owned by a cloud vendor.
2. The public cloud is more amenable to provide elasticity and scaling on demand as the resources are shared between multiple users, and overprovisioned resources are managed efficiently as well.
3. A public cloud deployment introduces a third party in any legal proceedings of the enterprise.
4. Public clouds may have disruptions in the network bandwidth and costs between the client and the cloud service.
5. The amount of time over which the storage is offered is also a factor in public cloud.
6. Public clouds may offer additional application services and enable outsourcing the entire infrastructure, and offload core complexities in maintainence.
7. Private clouds are more cost effective for medium to large workloads, and public clouds for smaller workloads.

Usually, hybrid clouds are used for scaling. Vertically hybrid clouds are expensive due to the high cost of data transfer, but horizontally scaled hybrids are efficient as the entire application is replicated in the public clouds and the usage of the private cloud is for the normal workloads.

The main advantages of CC are
1. Scalability
2. Cost
3. Agility
4. Innovation
5. Manageability

The main downsides of public clouds are
1. Security
2. Compliance of the cloud security provider
3. Interoperability and Vendor lock in
   1. Once a public cloud is chosen, migrating away is not easy as the cloud is customised.
