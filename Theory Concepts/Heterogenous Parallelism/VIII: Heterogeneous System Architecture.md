# Heterogeneous System Architecture

The HSA foundation provides tools to develop a platform for heterogenenous systems.

The high level features are
1. Unified addressing across all processors
2. Operation into pageable system memory
3. Full memory coherency
4. User mode dispatch
5. Architected queuing language
6. High level language support for GPU compute
7. Preemption and context switching

HSAIL code can be compiled on the fly like a JIT compiler on any HSA device.

Bolt provide parallel primitives library for HSA.
