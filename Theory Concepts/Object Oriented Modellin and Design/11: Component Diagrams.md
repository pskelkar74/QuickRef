# Component Diagrams

- A component is an independent autonomous unit in a system
  - We divide a system into their own functional atomic subsystems
  - By applying a set of rules
  - Can be used to describe a system of arbitrary size and complexity
  - UML Component diagrams enable to model the high level software components and the interfaces to them
  - They can be easily reused and replaced
  - Referred also to as Wiring Diagrams

- A component has the following elements
  - Interface
    - An interface is a declaration of a set of operations
  - Usage dependency
    - Relationship where one element requires another for implementation
  - Ports
    - Represents an interaction point between a component and its environment
  - Connector
    - Connects two components
    - Connect external contract of a component to internal structure

- A rectangle is used to represent a component
- Interfaces can be denoted by
  - Socket ball: Where two components use the same interface
    - Component providing the interface takes the ball side, and the one using takes the socket side
  - Rectangle with `<<interface>>` in the body, with dependency arrows from components
  - Multiple components can be connected to the same interface using a Ball socket split into multiple components servicing that interface
- Dependencies are denoted by
  - Dotted arrows, with dependency type
  - Head points to independent type
  - `<<use>>`
    - If a component gets a request, and the calculation is done on the component
  - `<<delegate>>`
    - If a component gets a request, and the calculation is delegated to another component
- Ports are denoted by
  - Specifies a distinct interaction point between
    - Component and environment
    - Component and internal parts
  - Square symbol
  - Can be named
  - Interface attached specify the nature of that port
- Assembly Connectors
  - Everything put together
  - Tells how the components are interconnected
  - Interfaces should be compatible
- Delegation connector
  - Denoted by socket and arrow
  - A port may delegate to a set of ports on subordinate components
  - The union of target interfaces must be signature compatible with source interface

- Views of a component
  - Internal View
    - Realises components nested within the component
    - Realisation is a relationship between 2 sets of model elements
      - One represents specification
      - Other represents implementation of the latter
    - Internal classes that realise the behavior of the parent
  - External view
    - Just publicly visible props
    - Interface can be listed in the compartment of a component box
