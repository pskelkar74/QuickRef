# Structured Approach vs OO

- Sharing interface can be done by
  - Inheritance
  - Duck Typing

- Inheritance is done for
  - Reuse
  - Polymorphic behavior

- OOMD uses
  - Classes 
  - Objects
  - Relation between classes
    - Inheritance
    - Composition and aggregation
    - Association

- Structured approach
  - Divides the problem into subproblems recursively
  - Solves these using algorithms or functions
  - Also called procedural approach
  - Adding new behavior is easy
  - Adding new type is difficult

- Object Oriented approach
  - Divides the problem into classes, objects and hierarchy of classes
  - Solves the problem using these relationships
  - Adding new behavior is difficult
  - Adding new type is easy

- OO is considered better for
  - Reuse
  - Maintenance
