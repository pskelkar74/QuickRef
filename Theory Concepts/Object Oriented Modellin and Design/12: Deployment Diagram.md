# Deployment Diagram

- Shows the hardware design and the communication between them
  - High level design
  - Structure of the runtime

- A node is a hardware component (rectangle)
- A solid straight line is used for communication
- How they're communicating is denoted on the line
- A device describes a node in detail (rectangle)
  - Name
  - Attributes
  - Operations
- Artifacts are concrete elements caused by the development process (libs, executables)

- Steps to draw a deployment diagram
  - Find the purpose and identify devices and nodes
  - Find the relationships between nodes and devices
  - Identify other objects to add
  - Add dependencies
