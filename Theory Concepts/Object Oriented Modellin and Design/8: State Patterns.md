# State Patterns

- #IFNDEF is used to avoid inclusions of header files more than once in the same context

- A design pattern is
  - A solution to a recurring problem in design
  - Not a coding solution
  - May have multiple implementations for the same pattern

- Diagrams indicate classes participating in the pattern

- State Patterns
  - Concrete state objects can be made dynamically
  - Change of state may be ordered or may test before changing
  - States change in a cyclic fashion
  - Constructors of classes might initialise the objects
  - Safe implementation
  - All concrete objects can be shared or may not be shared
