# Introduction to OOMD

- Unified Modelling Language
  - It is used to graphically represent artefacts of design using OO methodology
  - We use UML because
    - Natural language is not very precise, and is not understood the same way across the world.
    - UML design stays constant
  - UML is a standard language for writing software blueprints
  - UML may be used to 
    - Visualise
    - Specify
    - Construct
    - Document the artifacts of a software intensive system

- Modelling
  - Simplification of reality
    - Different levels of abstraction
    - Different levels of details
    - Multiple views for the same system
      - Structural => static view
      - Behavioural => dynamic view

- Characteristics of Modelling
  - Models help us visualise a system as it is or as we want it to be
  - Models permit us to specify the structure or behavior of a system
  - Models give us a template that guides us in constructing a system
  - Models document the decisions we have made

- Principles of Modelling
  - The choice of what models to create has a profound influence on how a problem is attacked and how a solution is shaped
  - Every model may be expressed at different levels of precision
  - Best models are connected to reality
